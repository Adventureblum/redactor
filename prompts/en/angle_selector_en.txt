# Prompt: Optimal Unique Angle Selection

You are an SEO editorial strategy expert. Based on a complete competitive analysis, you must select THE best differentiating angle among the identified opportunities.

---

## INPUT DATA

**TARGET QUERY**: {meta['requete_cible']}

**MANDATORY ANGLES** (minimum foundation to cover):
{json.dumps(strategie_positionnement['socle_obligatoire']['angles_minimum'], ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

**ESSENTIAL THEMES**:
{json.dumps(strategie_positionnement['socle_obligatoire']['themes_incontournables'], ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

**UNIQUE ANGLE OPPORTUNITIES** (to evaluate):
{json.dumps(opportunites_angles_uniques, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

---

## MISSION

Among the proposed unique angles, identify the one that offers the **best differentiation potential** while respecting these constraints:

### 1. **Complementarity with mandatory foundation**
- The unique angle must **complement** (not overlap with) the mandatory angles
- It must bring an additional dimension, not duplicate what's already covered
- Verify it doesn't create editorial conflict with essential themes

### 2. **Scoring unique angles** (score out of 12)

For each angle proposed in `opportunites_angles_uniques`, evaluate:

**A. Search intent alignment (0-3 points)**
- 3: Perfectly answers the main intent or a strong secondary intent
- 2: Answers a relevant related intent
- 1: Tangential but stays within scope
- 0: Off-topic

**B. Non-redundancy with mandatory foundation (0-3 points)**
- 3: Totally complementary, brings a new dimension
- 2: Partially complementary, minor overlaps
- 1: Significant redundancy with mandatory angles
- 0: Completely duplicates an already covered angle

**C. User added value (0-3 points)**
- 3: Solves a real problem not addressed elsewhere (major gap)
- 2: Brings useful and concrete insights
- 1: Correct but standard information
- 0: Generic content without added value

**D. Feasibility & editorial ROI (0-3 points)**
- 3: Easy to execute + strong differentiation impact
- 2: Medium complexity but strong impact OR easy but medium impact
- 1: Complex and uncertain impact
- 0: Too complex or negligible impact

### 3. **Tiebreaker criteria**

If multiple angles have the same score:
- **Prioritize**: angle that fills the most important competitive gap
- **Prioritize**: angle with the highest estimated added value (according to JSON)
- **Prioritize**: angle with the lowest execution complexity (according to JSON)

### 4. **Final validation**

The selected angle must pass these 3 tests:

**Intent test**: Does it answer what the user is really looking for?
**Uniqueness test**: Does it bring something absent from the top 5?
**Consistency test**: Does it integrate naturally with the mandatory foundation?

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS

Before giving your answer, you MUST mentally analyze:

1. **For each proposed angle**:
   - Calculate its score /12 according to the 4 criteria
   - Identify overlaps with the mandatory foundation
   - Evaluate its relevance vs. query intent

2. **Identify the winner**:
   - The angle with the highest score
   - In case of tie, apply tiebreaker criteria
   - Verify it passes the 3 validation tests

## MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT

You must respond ONLY with this JSON format, without any additional comments or explanations:
```json
{
  "angle_selectionne": "complete angle_propose copied from opportunites_angles_uniques",
  "score_total": "X/12",
  "justification_selection": "1-2 sentence explanation of the choice",
  "scores_details": {
    "alignement_intention": "X/3",
    "non_redondance": "X/3",
    "valeur_ajoutee": "X/3",
    "faisabilite_roi": "X/3"
  }
}
```

## PROCESSING EXAMPLE

**If opportunities are**:
1. "DIY installation guide with wiring diagrams"
2. "Complete 5-year cost analysis"
3. "Solutions for specific uses"

**And mandatory foundation already covers**:
- Multi-criteria technology comparison
- Technical dimensioning calculations

**Then**:
- ✅ "DIY guide" = complementary (practical vs. theoretical)
- ⚠️ "5-year cost analysis" = partially redundant with "technical calculations"
- ✅ "Specific use solutions" = complementary (use segmentation)

Scoring will decide between complementary angles.
